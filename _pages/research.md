1. **Constrained regret minimization for multi-criterion stochastic bandits** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09649)
(Mar'19 to June'19) <br>
*Advisors: Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair, EE, IITB & Prof. Krishna Jagannathan, EE, IITM* <br>
*Introduction*: We formulate a new approach to consider multiple criteria in a stochastic bandit framework. The aim is to maximize the pulls of an arm which optimizes a certain criterion while satisfying constraints on the other criteria. In particular, we look at the problem of risk-constrained loss minimization but the analysis can be easily extended to more general settings. 
 <br>
- Formulated the problem of CVaR-constrained expected loss minimization and defined the notion of a consistent algorithm for the proposed setting. 
- Proposed a consistent algorithm, RC-LCB, and proved that the expected number of pulls of a non-optimal arm is bounded by a term logarithmic in the horizon.  
- Proved an inherent tension between regret minimization and feasibility identification, i.e., identifying if any
arm satisfies the constraint on CVaR or not.

*Introduction*: We formulate a new approach to consider multiple criteria in a stochastic bandit framework. The aim is to maximize the pulls of an arm which optimizes a certain criterion while satisfying constraints on the other criteria. In particular, we look at the problem of risk-constrained loss minimization but the analysis can be easily extended to more general settings. 
 <br>
- Formulated the problem of CVaR-constrained expected loss minimization and defined the notion of a consistent algorithm for the proposed setting. 
- Proposed a consistent algorithm, RC-LCB, and proved that the expected number of pulls of a non-optimal arm is bounded by a term logarithmic in the horizon.  
- Proved an inherent tension between regret minimization and feasibility identification, i.e., identifying if any
arm satisfies the constraint on CVaR or not.

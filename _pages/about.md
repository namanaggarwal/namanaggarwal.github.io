I am a Fourth Year (B.Tech) student of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. My interests broadly lie in **Stochastic and Decentralized Control, Applied Probability, Optimization** and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems. 

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring problems broadly in Stochastic and Networked control, Game Theory and Optimization. I spent the summer of 2019 working under the guidance of [Dr. Aditya Paranjape](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ap2da) at Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC Pune) on applications of reinforcement learning in industry, particularly the inventory control problem. During the junior year of my undergraduate degree (Fall 2018 and Spring 2019), I spent my time studying Visual-Inertial Navigation of UAVs and Vision.

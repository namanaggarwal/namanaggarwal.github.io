I am a final year student in the Interdisciplinary Dual Degree program (B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering + M.Tech in Systems and Control Engineering) at IIT Bombay. My interests broadly lie in **Stochastic and Decentralized Control, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am interested in the theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring problems broadly in Stochastic and Networked control, Game Theory and Optimization. I spent the summer of 2019 working under the guidance of [Dr. Aditya Paranjape](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ap2da) at Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC Pune) on applications of reinforcement learning in industry, particularly the inventory control problem.

To know more about my projects, you can head over to the [Projects](https://namanaggarwal.github.io/projects/) page and my CV can be found [here](https://namanaggarwal.github.io/cv/). You can contact me at [naman_agg[at]iitb.ac.in](mailto:naman_agg@iitb.ac.in).

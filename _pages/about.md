I am a Fourth Year (B.Tech) student of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay. My interests broadly lie in **Stochastic and Decentralized Control, Applied Probability, Optimization** and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems. 

My bachelor's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring problems broadly in Stochastic and Networked control, Game Theory and Optimization. I spent the summer of 2019 working under the guidance of [Dr. Aditya Paranjape](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ap2da) at TRDDC Pune on applications of reinforcement learning in industry, particularly the inventory control problem. During the junior year of my undergraduate degree (Fall 2018 and Spring 2019), I spent my time studying Visual-Inertial Navigation of UAVs and Vision.

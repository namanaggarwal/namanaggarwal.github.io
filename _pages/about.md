Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I am a final year student in the Systems and Control Engineering Department at IIT Bombay. My research interests broadly lie in **Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Stochastic and Decentralized Control**. My past research experiences have prepared me well to carry out interdisciplinary research in these domains.

I am currently studying the role of information and privacy in stochastic dynamic decision problems as a part of my Master's thesis with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) (SC IITB). Previously, I have worked on mechanism design in the context of supply side markets with Prof. Kulkarni and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) (EE IITB) during my Bachelor's thesis. I have also spent a summer working on reinforcement learning based solutions for inventory control with [Dr. Aditya Paranjape](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4d54VyUAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Tata Research Development and Design Centre Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Research_Development_and_Design_Centre). Find details [here](https://namanaggarwal.github.io/research).

I am confident of my ability to adapt and work on varied themes given my background.
